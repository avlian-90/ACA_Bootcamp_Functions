elements depending on passed operation symbol. Write appropriate function for each operation.

3. Given a phone number. Write a function to clean it up, so it is valid. The rules are as follows:
    - If the phone number is less than 10 digits assume that it is a bad number
    - If the phone number is longer than 10, then it is a bad number
    - If the phone number is 10 digits assume that it is good
    - If the phone number consists of 11 symbols and the first one is + and others are numbers, then trim +
and return remaining 10 digits.
    - If the phone number contains + symbol more than one, consider it as a bad number.
    - If the phone number contains + symbol not as the first character, consider it as a badnumber.

9. Write a function which receives an array and a number as arguments and returns a new array from
the elements of the given array which are larger than the given number.
